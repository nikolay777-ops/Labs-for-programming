Hip-hop was born in 1973 thanks to Jamaica DJ Cool Herk, 
who turned on famous mixed songs on public party in Bronx.
So, he created one of the most famous music directions, 
but the first songs was created 6 years later by The Fatback Band. 
Electronic music operates with sounds that are capable of 
producing electronic and electromechanical musical instruments,
as well as sounds that arise from electrical / electronic devices,
which in the strict sense are not musical instruments.
Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers,
shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads.
Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths
flattened in pitch are also an essential part of the sound. 
In the 20th century, the direction was constantly changing, passing
through several characteristic stages of development.
During the 1930s and 1940s, the term was destabilized by the 
swing boom and be-bop movement.
